<h2>

    1. WHAT FEATURES DOES THE APP HAVE?

</h2>

<p>

    The aim of the #OstaniZdrav App is to disrupt chains of infections of SARS-CoV-2 at an early stage. The intention is to notify people quickly and reliably of any contact they may have had with infected individuals and any potential exposure to the virus. Based on this information, people will be able to avoid non-necessary contact with others, especially those at increased risk, such as the elderly or chronically ill patients and limit the spread of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.

    <br>

    <br>

    The key features of the App are set out below. The details provided are solely for your information. They do not constitute legally binding specifications or any agreement that certain features must be available. Please also consult the information and conditions in Section 9.

</p>

<h3>

    a. Background App

</h3>

<p>

    The App runs in the background on your device (i.e. when you are not actively using it), so it can automatically calculate your risk of infection. If you do not allow the App to run in the background of the operating system of your smartphone, the App will not function properly.

    <br>

    <br>

    Once a day, the #OstaniZdrav App makes a list of rolling proximity identifiers of those individuals who wanted to share the information with other users that there is a risk of infection. The App calculates these random IDs and compares them against the random IDs (temporary exposure keys) already stored in exposure logs on your device. If the exposure logging feature on your device detects a match, it sends the data (date, duration, signal strength) to the application; however, it does not send random IDs of the contact in question.

    <br>

    <br>

    Information on the risk assessment of infection is kept only in the application and is not communicated to other recipients (including NIJZ, MJU, Apple, Google and other persons).

    <br>

    <br>

    The App is only able to identify and register encounters with other persons only if the App is equally installed on a device carried by such person and if such person meets all the conditions for using the App (see section 6 below). The App as such is not able to register whether the user has had contact with other people.

</p>

<h3>b. Exposure notification</h3>

<p>

    You will receive a notification if you have had exposure, to someone diagnosed with coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and which presents an elevated risk of infection. The notification will contain recommendations by the NIJZ.

</p>

<h3>

    c. Positive test result

</h3>

<p>

    If your SARS-CoV-2 test is positive, you may use the App to voluntarily publish your own random IDs registered by the App for the last 14 days as diagnosis keys. This will enable other users to receive a notification (in case of elevated risk) an exposure notification.

</p>

<h3>

    d. Technical specifications of the App

</h3>

<p>

    Details of the technical features of the App and related systems are available at:

    <br>

    https://github.com/si-covid-19/ostanizdrav-android

    <br>

    These technical specifications are for information purposes and do not form part of these Terms of Use. They are not a legally binding agreement regarding the quality or specifications for the App.

</p>

<h3>

    e. Further Information

</h3>

<p>

    Further information on the App is available at "https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/the-ostanizdrav-mobile-application/"

    <br>

    <br>

    Further information on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic is available at "https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/"

</p>

<h2>

    2. WHAT DOES LOW OR ELEVATED RISK MEAN?

</h2>

<p>

    The App uses random IDs of confirmed exposures to calculate the user’s indicative individual risk. It uses factors, such as days since exposure, exposure duration, the proximity to a confirmed case based on the Bluetooth signal attenuation and any transmission risk. The App will then tell you whether you are at “low risk” or “elevated risk”. This is purely indicative assessment based on the data collected. <strong>The App cannot tell you whether you are actually infected with coronavirus SARS-CoV-2.</strong> You may still be infected if you are categorised as “low risk” and you may not be infected even if you are placed in the “elevated risk” category.

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>There are a number of other factors which may affect your own personal risk of infection. The App will not take those factors into account.</strong> They include your own personal circumstances, external circumstances of any exposure to a confirmed case, your behaviour and any contact with anyone who is not registered in the App. See also Section 4.

</p>

<h2>

    3. WHAT DO I DO IF I HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A CONFIRMED CASE?

</h2>

<p>

    If the App notifies you that you have been exposed to a confirmed case, you will also receive information on what to do next. These instructions are not legally binding, but the NIJZ recommends that you follow them. The recommendations referred to above do not affect any applicable legal or contractual obligations or any official requirements on what to do in the event of any exposure to a confirmed case. You must simply comply with any such obligations and requirements.

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>The App cannot be used to provide any form of medical diagnosis.</strong>

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>The notification does not mean that you have SARS-CoV-2.</strong> It simply means that you have been exposed to someone with a confirmed case of SARS-CoV-2 during the last 14 days and that you may also potentially have been infected. The classification of risk as "low" or "elevated" is based solely on the available data and does not indicate whether you have actually been infected.

    <br>

    <br>

    <strong>You may receive an exposure notification which is not accurate.</strong> Your device may, for example, register an exposure at a time when you are not close to your device or while someone else is using it. Exposures may also be wrongly registered due to existing limitations in contact/proximity measurement (see Section 7).

</p>

<h2>

    4. THE APP DOES PROTECT YOU AGAINST INFECTION

</h2>

<p>

    The App serves to disrupt chains of infection.

    <br>

    <strong>The App will not protect you against infection with SARS-CoV-2.</strong>

    <br>

    <strong>The App does not reduce your own personal risk of infection.</strong>

    <br>

    <strong>You can still catch SARS-CoV-2 without the App notifying you of the exposure to the person who may have infected you, as:</strong>

</p>

<ul>

    <li>

        The App does not register all your contact with other people. This may be because other people are not using the App, you do not always have your device on you, or you do not have the App activated at all times. There are also certain limitations in terms of contact/proximity measurement (see Section 7 below).

    </li>

    <li>

        The App only notifies you of potential exposures to confirmed cases. The App needs to have registered your contact with a confirmed case and the infected individual needs to have activated the App's warning feature. Activating the warning feature is voluntary and not all infected individuals may do so.

    </li>

</ul>

<p>

    Please use the App in conjunction with the other relevant precautions and official requirements. Reliable information on the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic and the precautions you should take is available at:
    <br>

"https://www.gov.si/en/topics/coronavirus-disease-covid-19/"
    <br>
https://www.nijz.si/en/coronavirus-disease-covid-19"

    <br>

    <br>

    The above is purely for your information and does not form part of these Terms of Use.

    <br>

    <br>

    Always follow these rules, including when you are using the App:

</p>

<ul>

    <li>

        Practice social distancing (at least 1,5 m).

    </li>

    <li>

        Wash or disinfect your hands regularly.

    </li>

    <li>

        Wear a mask in all closed spaces when it is not possible to maintain the recommended social distance.

    </li>

    <li>

        Do not touch your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed or contaminated hands

    </li>

    <li>

        Regularly air closed spaces.

    </li>

    <li>

        Follow the appropriate cough hygiene (before coughing/sneezing cover your mouth with a paper tissue or cough/sneeze into the top of your sleeve). Throw away the paper tissue after each use and wash your hands with soap and water.

    </li>

    <li>

        In case of signs and symptoms, stay home and call your GP.

    </li>

</ul>

<p>

    This is the best way to protect yourself and others against the virus.

</p>

<h2>

    5. WARNING FEATURE

</h2>

<p>

    You can use the App to warn other people you have had contact with that you have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. <strong>You may only activate the warning feature if your positive test result came from an competent institutions.</strong>

    <br>

    <br>

    After receiving information on the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus infection, the epidemiological service will contact you and provide you with a confirmation code, which you will be able to enter into the application and anonymously inform your close contacts about an increased risk of infection.

    <br>

    If you suspect that you are infected with SARS-CoV-2 and have not received confirmation, follow the general recommendations of the NIJZ.

</p>

<h3>

    a. Use of the warning feature without good reason

</h3>

<p>

    <strong>You may not activate the warning feature without good reason and doing so may have serious consequences.</strong> You may be held liable for damages towards other infected users.

</p>

<h2>

    6. TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS

</h2>

<p>

    The following technical requirements need to be met in order to use the App:

</p>

<h3>

    a. You will need and Internet connection

</h3>

<p>

    Certain features of the App are based on central services and systems provided by for the functioning of the #OstaniZdrav App. These features are therefore only available if your device has an internet data connection, e.g. via LTE or Wi-Fi, enabling access to the #OstaniZdrav App. Some or all of the features of the App will not be available if you do not have a data connection. The same will apply when your device is turned off or in flight mode.

</p>

<h3>

    b. The App must be running and activated

</h3>

<p>

    The App must be running on your device (in the foreground or background) and must be activated. If you fail to launch the App, or deactivate or quit the App, it will not register any encounters with other people and will not generate any random IDs which can be stored by other devices. You will need to relaunch the App if you restart your device (e.g. after turning it off, when the battery runs out or following an operating system update).

</p>

<h3>

    c. Settings on your device

</h3>

<p>

    You will also need to activate the Bluetooth (BLE) functions on your device and allow the App to access them.

    <br>

    It is recommended activating the following functions on your device and allowing the App to access them, although you will still be able to use the basic features of the App without them:

</p>

<ul>

    <li>

        Notifications

    </li>

</ul>

<p>

    Please check the settings on your device to see whether these functions are activated and may be accessed by the App.

    <br>

    <br>

    Detailed instructions on how to set up the App for iOS and Android are available on https://www.gov.si/en/ostanizdrav. These instructions are for information purposes only and do not form part of these Terms of Use.

</p>

<h3>

    d. Make sure that you are using the latest version of the App

</h3>

<p>

    The MJU and NIJZ will publish occasional updates for the App. You will need to install these updates as soon as possible and ensure that you are always using the newest version of the App. Using older versions of the App may lead to technical issues or disruptions.

    <br>

    <br>

    The App uses functions implemented specifically by Apple on iOS and Google on Android ("exposure notification"). These are only available on iOS version 13.5 and upwards and Android version 6 and upwards. The App does not work with earlier versions of those operating systems.

</p>

<h2>

    7. LIMITATIONS OF THE APP

</h2>

<p>

    The App is designed to help you identify exposures you have had to people who subsequently was infected with SARS-CoV-2. But you should always remember that the App has certain limitations.

    <br>

    One of these is that, while the App is constantly sending out random IDs (rolling proximity identifiers), it only receives random IDs from other devices at specific intervals. The windows for receiving data in the App are currently up to five minutes apart and are only very short. All these functionalities are based on the underlying Exposure Notification Framework from Apple and Google and can be changed by these companies at any time.

    <br>

    <br>

    The Bluetooth signal attenuation is used for measuring proximity. A lower signal attenuation essentially means that the other device is closer. A higher signal attenuation means that either the other device is further away (i.e. a distance of more than two metres) or there is something between the two devices blocking the signal. This might include something like a wall or a bag containing the device, but it could just as easily be people or animals
